 BistroBasket is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that allows users to input their own recipes and ingredients. Users can create, store, and share their recipes, as well as generate a corresponding shopping list with the ingredients. The app also enables users to explore and add other people's recipes to their collection and subsequently to their grocery list.
